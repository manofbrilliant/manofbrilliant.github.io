# About Me

## Introduction
I am a versatile and experienced web developer with a strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL, and Flutter. My journey in the tech world began with foundational languages like C and C++, which have given me a robust understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving skills. As the founder and CEO of **AIcyborg**, I lead a dynamic team in creating innovative solutions that blend artificial intelligence and web technologies to address real-world challenges.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am also a published author. My books, *Younghard* and *A Digital Revolution in a Child's Story*, reflect my passion for storytelling and my commitment to inspiring the next generation of tech enthusiasts.

At **AIcyborg**, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. Our focus is on developing cutting-edge AI-driven web applications that enhance user experience and drive innovation. Under my leadership, we strive to create a collaborative environment where creativity and technical excellence intersect.
